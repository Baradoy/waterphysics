# WaterPhysics
A Mod for the sci-fi colony sim Rimworld

# Goal

WaterPhsyics will add flowing rivers, flooding and moisture based soil fertility to Rimwolrd.

# Status

This mod is a work in progress and pre-alpha.

# Plan

Each cell will have an elevation, hydration and top water. Top water will flow to lower elevation, and seep into soil.

Weather events will add or remove weather to the system. New weather events will cause severe flooding.

Landscaping will raise or lower the elevation of cells. Storm reliefs and river shaping will play an important role in the game.
